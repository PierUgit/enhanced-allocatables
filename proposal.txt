Subject: extending the allocatable arrays to be dynamically resizable
Date: 2024-01-25
#Reference:

1. Introduction

Following (and somehow extending) the C++ vector class principle, 
the proposal is to be able to resize an already allocated array, 
keeping or not the existing content, without necessarily 
freeing/reallocating the memory. It is also about dynamically 
changing the bounds of an array.


2. Motivation

A typical use case is iteratively appending a scalar to an existing
array, but the final size of the array is unknown:

    program foo
    real, allocatable :: a(:)
    real :: x
    !...
    allocate( a(0) )
    do
       ! get the scalar x, whatever the mean (file reading, computations,...)
       a = [a, x]
       if (<some test>) exit
    end do
    !...
    end

This is inefficient, because very often the `a = [a, x]` instruction 
is actually achieved with one temporary allocation and one data copy:
    allocate( tmp(size(a)+1) )
    tmp(1:size(a)) = a(:)
    tmp(size(a+1)) = x
    call move_alloc(tmp,a)

Several workarounds can be used to get better performances, but 
they all require more code.


3. Proposed solution

3.1. Introduction

Similarly to C++ vectors, the Fortran allocatable arrays have a new
*capacity* property, corresponding to the actually allocated memory 
volume (expressed in number of elements). The capacity is larger or 
equal to the size, and the difference `capacity - size` is the 
overprovisioning. When resizing an array, no actual malloc/copy/free 
is needed as long as the new size does not exceed the current capacity.

When resizing, an efficient allocation strategy aims at reducing the 
occurences of actual malloc/copy/free
- the capacity is (possibly iteratively) doubled if the new size 
  exceeds the current capacity
- optionaly, the capacity is (possibly iteratively) halved if the 
  new size gets below a given percentage of the current capacity (e.g. 33%) (*)
- the compiler may cap the overprovisioning (possibly as a function 
  of the available physical memory)
- the user can overide the default overprovisioning strategy
- the compiler is free to internally adjust the capacity (e.g. for 
  alignment purposes)

One important point is the ability to keep the existing content of 
an array when resized (or a part of it if the array is shrinked). 
And this is also important to note that for rank > 1 arrays keeping 
the existing content is possible only if the sizes do not change on 
the dimensions other than the last one: this is a consequence of the 
column-major memory layout used by Fortran.

(*) if the threshold was set to 50% for the capacity decrease, there 
could be too frequent malloc/copy/free in some corner cases. Setting 
a threshold much below 50% introduces a desirable hysterisis. Note that 
there's no decrease strategy in the C++ vectors.

The `allocate()` statement behaves exactly the same as before (without 
overprovioning). The new behavior is obtained only through a new 
`resize()` statement. Apart from the pure resizing feature, it also 
offers other useful features.


3.2. Examples

On a rank-3 array `a`, changing the lower bound of the 1st dimension 
without changing the size, do nothing on the 2nd dimension, and changing 
the size of the 3rd dimension. The existing content is kept:
    resize( a(-2: , : ,10000) )
 
Appending a scalar `x` to a rank-1 array `a` (the existing content is kept):
    resize(a, append=x)
(similar to `a = [a, x]`, but this one ignores the overprovisioning)

Appending a rank-2 array x to a rank-3 array `a` (the existing content 
is kept)... Yes, the syntax is the same:
    resize(a, append=x)
(similar to the Matlab notation `a = [a, x]`, which in contrast to Fortran 
is valid for ranks > 1)

Dropping the last 5 2D slices in a rank-3 array (the rest of the content 
is kept; the capacity cannot decrease):
    resize( a, drop=5 )
This is equivalent to (but more readable than):
    resize( a(:,:,lbound(a,3):ubound(a,3)-5) )
And similar to `a = a(:,:,lbound(a,3):ubound(a,3)-5)` (but this one ignores 
the overprovisioning)

Dropping the last 100 elements of a rank-1 array (the existing content is kept), 
allowing the capacity to possibly decrease:
    resize( a, drop=100, container='any' )

Forcing the capacity to the size of the array `a` (the existing content is kept):
    resize( a, container='fit' )

Resizing an array `a` to the same bounds and sizes than a array `b` 
(the content is not kept):
    resize( a, mold=b )

Cloning an array `b` (including the content) to the array `a` (obviously the 
existing content of `a` is not kept):
    resize( a, source=b )

Enlarging a rank-2 array `a` along the 2nd dimension, keeping the existing 
content, and initializing the NEW elements with the scalar `0.0`
    resize( a(:,1000), source=0.0 )

Enlarging a rank-2 array `a` along the 1st dimension, not keeping the 
existing content, and (re-)initializing ALL the elements with the scalar `0.0`
    resize( a(1000,:), keep=.false. source=0.0 )


3.3. Syntax

Although the `resize` is unique, it has fundamentaly 3 different modes that 
cannot be mixed, and it's clearer to describe them separatly. 

3.3.1. `resize` mode 1

Resizing an array by specifying new bounds/sizes. The existing data can 
be kept or not

    resize( arr[(array-bounds-list)] [,keep=k] [,source=s] &
            [,capacity=c |,container=con] )

`arr`
- any array, unallocated or already allocated
- `r = rank(arr)`

For each dimension the bounds can be:
- `( : )` : the bounds and size are not modified
- `(lb: )` : specifying a new lower bound; the upper bound is modified 
  accordingly (the size does not change)
- `( :ub)` : specifying a new upper bound; the lower bound is modified 
  accordingly (the size does not change)
- `(sz)` : specifying a new size; the new lower bound is 1
- `(lb:ub)` : specifying new lower and upper bounds (and hence a new size)

`keep=k`
- `k` is a logical scalar
  - .true.: the existing content of the array is kept in all cases
  - .false. (default): the existing content of the array is not kept
  - if any of the sizes of first (r-1) dimensions of `arr` changes, then 
  `k` cannot be `.true.

`source=s`
- `s` is a scalar of the same TK as `arr`
  - if `keep=.true.`, the NEW elements (if there are) are initialized to `s`
  - if `keep=.false.`, ALL the elements are initialized to `s`

`capacity=c`
- `c` is an integer scalar, used to force the capacity to a desired value
- the actual capacity is internally set at least to the final size of `arr`

`container=con`
- `con` is a character(*) scalar:
  - `'grow'` (default): the capacity can only increase
  - `'any'`: the capacity can increase or decrease
  - `'fit'`: the capacity is set to the final size of `arr`

3.3.2  `resize` mode 2

Resizing an array by appending or dropping elements  
The existing data are kept (except the dropped elements!)

    resize( arr [,append=a | ,drop=d] [,capacity=c |,container=con] )

`arr`, `capacity=c`, `container=con`
- same as in mode 1

`append=a`
- `a` is an array of the same TK as `arr`
- the rank of `a` must be `r` or `r-1`
- the sizes of the first (r-1) dimensions of `a` must match the sizes of the 
  first (r-1) dimensions of `arr` (this cannot be checked at compile time, though) 
- `a` is appended to `arr`; the size of the last dimension of `arr` is increased by:
  - 1 if `a` is rank r-1
  - size(a,dim=r) if `a` is rank r

`drop=d`
- `d` is an integer scalar
- drops the `d` last rank r-1 slices of `array`
- the size of the last dimension of `arr` is decreased by `d`

3.3.3. `resize` mode 3


Resizing an array by cloning the shape, and possibly the content, of another
array. The existing data are not kept

    resize( arr [,mold=m | ,source=s] [,capacity=c |,container=con] )

`arr`, `capacity=c`, `container=con`
- same as in mode 1

`mold=m`
- `m` is an array of the same TKR as `arr`
- works exactly like in the `allocate` statement

`source=s`
- s` is an array of the same TKR as `arr`
- works exactly like in the `allocate` statement

3.3.4. `capacity`

    c = capacity(arr [,kind=ik])

Integer function that returns the capacity of an allocatable array.


3.4 Alternative syntax

All the features decribed for the new `resize` statement could instead 
be included in the existing `allocate` statement.  
- Pros:
  - no new statement, `allocate` can be used for all purposes
Cons:
  - most of time the resizability and the associated overprovisioning 
   are not needed. This could be solved by changing the default of `container=` 
   to "fit" whenever `allocate` is called with an unallocated array
  - allocating an already allocated array by mistake could no longer be detected

3.5 assignments

what should happen in `a = <rhs>`, `a` being an allocatable array?

For "simplicity" the inheritance of the capacity should follow the same 
rule as the inheritance of the bounds, that is:
- if the shape of <rhs> is the same as the shape of `a`, `a` keeps its 
  current capacity
- if the shape of <rhs> differs from the shape of `a`, `a` inherits the 
  capacity of <rhs>; more precisely
  - if <rhs> is itself an allocatable array, without any selector, `a` 
    gets the same capacity as <rhs> after the assignment (in other words 
    it's a full clone of <rhs>)
  - otherwise the capacity of `a` is set to the final size of `a`
    (no overprovisioning)

4. demonstration code

This proposal has been implemented for limited cases (rank-1 and rank-2 
default integer arrays) in a demonstration code:
https://github.com/PierUgit/enhanced-allocatables

This code relies on the C interoperability and the direct manipulation 
of the C array descriptors: it is non standard and therefore non portable 
(it works with ifort 21 and gfortran 13). Note also that it is a bit 
different from the proposal, because the latter has evolved since the 
code has been written. Nonetheless, it shows that the implementation in 
the compilers would probably be fairly simple, with an addional `capacity` 
component in the array descriptor. Moreover, it seems that some (most of?,
all?) compilers already implement some (very limited) overprovisioning 
(maybe for alignment purpose?).

As an example, the iterative appending operation is lightning fast in this 
code, compared to the `a = [a, x]` way.


5. Limitations / Issues / Objections

5.1. Only along the last dimension?

So far, many things above (resizing without reallocating, appending, ...)
are described only wrt the last dimension. They could be extended to all the
dimensions, but this would break the contiguity property of the allocatable 
arrays. The bacward compability wouldn't be affected I think, but the 
underlying behavior of some codes may change. If one would want to treat all 
the dimensions similarly, a new attribute would probably be required, e.g.
`resizable` instead of `allocatable`.

5.2. Isn't virtual memory making all of this pointless?

Modern OS's differentiate virtual memory and resident memory. They can 
allocatable huge amounts of the former one, and map it to physical pages
(in the RAM or in the swap files) only once accessed. When not knowing
the final size of an array one can allocate a large amount and just use 
what's needed on the fly: the unused part will never occupy any physical
space. In some sense, this can make the resize features maybe not useless,
but at least less useful.

5.3. Array bounds

If the array bounds list was provided by rank-1 arrays (as introduced 
in Fortran 2023), the compiler could not check at compile time which 
dimensions are potentially resized, and therefore could not determine 
if keeping the existing content is possible or not. So it's probably 
better to not allow this syntax in `resize()`.

5.4. Names

The `container=` specifier and the values it can take may have better names.
